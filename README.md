# PantryPlanner-V2

- See original PantryPlanner before reading this

Original Pantry planner was going to be written with React, but due to the time constraint from the project due date and since our group was not comfortable enough with React to create a web app, the app was built using EJS and JQUERY instead. The backend will use Node.js and mongoDB.
